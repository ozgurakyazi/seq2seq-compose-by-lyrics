    "# Composing Through Lyrics\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to learn the relation between the lyrics of a song and its music. It is certain that different kind of lyrics require some different kind of music that indicate the connotation behind the used words. From a technical point of view, we have two sequences that we are trying to relate:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The first sequence is a list of words of the lyrics of the song.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The second sequence is a list of notes/chords that compose the music of the song.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that being said, we built an encoder/decoder seq2seq model with GRU recurrent units to try to capture the relationship between the lyrics and the music.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to acquire some training data we needed to get creative. We thought of gathering midi files of songs that already contain the lyrics and use these as training data. Although the idea is valid, but gathering the data was a huge challenge towards this project. Most of the midi files on the internet are either expensive to get (it is the same kind of files that is used for kareoke), or the files are assumed that they contain the lyrics while in reality they do not. Luckily we were able to find http://www.olgris.kiev.ua/des/midi%20lat.html, which was our main source of data. The website contains 230 midi files with all different genres of music.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background Knowledge\n",
    "In order to be able to work with the midi files, we needed to know what a midi file is in the first place in order to look in the right place for the data required. Without going into much detail, midi files are byte-encoded files that include all different information about a piece of music. The most important building units of a midi file are the tracks. A midi file includes a track for every instrument played in that song. However there is one special track, usually that of the piano, that includes also the lyrics. Each track consists of several events of different types. Each event contains then its own metadata that is used when playing the file. There are two important types of events in every track:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The \"NOTE\" event which is translated to a certain sound, and\n",
    "    \n",
    "2) The \"LYRIC\" event that contains the word or words at a specific position.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Events in a track are sequential data and are thus played in certain order. This is why the piano track is considered for this project. In order to be able to generate more data, we considered the sentence level of the lyrics. All notes/chords sequence associated with a sentence is extracted and treated as a training sample. Sentence are recognized through a return character, which a patter recognized while working on the midi files.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, midi files are byte-encoded files, and it would have been quite a hassle to work with them as raw files. This is why we used the music21 library developed at MIT https://web.mit.edu/music21/. Before getting started, please follow the installation instructions stated below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installation steps\n",
    "Please install all packages listed in requirements.txt by running \"pip install -r requirements.txt\".\n",
    "In addition to that, spaCy was used for text preprocessing. This is why a spaCy model needs to be downloaded with the command \"python -m spacy download en\". Ultimately, the package timidity needs to be installed in order to play music in this notebook. Install timidity via the command \"sudo apt-get install timidity timidity-interfaces-extra\""
